        <h2 class="ten-one"><i>Ten One Tea House</i></h2>  
    </div>
    <p class="ten-one-description"><i>Ten One Tea House</i> is one of numerous boba shops on Brown University's campus.
        Many students and families frequent this establishment for a quick, refreshing
        beverage or dessert. In the shop is a kiosk powered by <i>Snackpass</i> that customers 
        may use to order their food or drink. Below are two Personas
        representing two possible users for this interface as well as a storyboard.
        Before constructing these, I observed and interviewed users of this interface.
    </p>

    <p class="ten-one-description">
        <b>Description: </b>Having first downloaded the <i>Snackpass</i> app, users 
        select their desired menu items and specify their preferences (e.g. type of milk, amount of ice)
        and toppings of choice. After they are satisfied with their cart, they finalize
        their order, pay, and type their phone number for notifications. This is all done
        by touch screen. Their <i>Snackpass</i> order number will be displayed, and they 
        will proceed to wait for their order to be completed.

        <h2 class="header">Observations</h2>
        <div class="body">
            <h4>Person 1</h4>
            <ul>
                College student. Very experienced with the interface. Listening to music on his earbuds.
                Goes in, orders, gets his drink, and leaves. Very fast and efficient.
            </ul>
            <h4>Person 2</h4>
            <ul>
                College student. Here with a friend. Shows friend stuff on her phone. Scrolls
                through the interface, deciding between all allotted options. Struggles a little with
                the touch screen. Feels bad about not giving a tip.
            </ul>
            <h4>Person 3</h4>
            <ul>
                Mother of two kids. Very experienced with the interface. On the phone. 
                Asks her kids many clarifying questions. Takes a photo of her kids.
            </ul>

        <h4>Was ordering easy?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Users thought that ordering was very easy.</li>
            <li>The lack of social interaction was a positive for some.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Most users felt that ordering was quick and intuitive.</li>
            <li>A first time user thought it was a bit annoying that they had to
                download Snackpass, as the register was not working that day.
            </li>

            <h2>Social Susie</h2>
            <p class="empathy-map-desc"> 
                Social Susie is a college student who came to <i>Ten One</i> for a quick
                pick me up. She is quite indecisive and can get annoyed by having to click
                between options. Susie is representative of the users of the <i>Ten One</i>
                kiosk because many college students use boba shops as a social location
                when they want a break from school.

                Multitasking Maria is a busy mom who is taking her daughter to get a treat after 
                going clothes shopping. Maria is quite experienced with the interface, though
                having to type in her phone number slows things down. Maria is representative
                of the users of the <i>Ten One</i> kiosk because young children love cold, sweet drinks, 
                and they need parents to take them to get them. Boba shops are often a stop before or 
                after some other errand(s).
